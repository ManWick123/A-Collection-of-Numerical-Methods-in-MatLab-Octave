## 1. Bisection Method:
A numerical method for finding the root of a function. The method works by repeatedly bisecting the interval that contains the root and then evaluating the function at the midpoint of the interval. The process is repeated until the error is within a specified tolerance.
    
## 2. Newton-Raphson Method: 
A numerical method for finding the root of a function. The method works by starting with an initial guess for the root and then using the derivative of the function to iteratively improve the guess. The process is repeated until the error is within a specified tolerance.
    
## 3. Fixed Point Iteration Method:
A numerical method for finding the root of a function. The method works by repeatedly applying a function to itself until the function converges to a fixed point. The fixed point is the root of the function.
    
## 4. Gaussian Elimination:
A method for solving a system of linear equations. The method works by transforming the system of equations into an upper triangular form, which can then be easily solved.
    
## 5. Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting Algorithm:
A variation of the Gaussian Elimination method that uses partial pivoting to improve the stability of the method.
    
## 6. Scaled Partial Pivoting:
A variation of the Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting method that uses scaled pivoting to further improve the stability of the method.
    
## 7. Matrix Factorization (LU Factorization):
A method for factorizing a matrix into a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The LU factorization can be used to solve a system of linear equations, to invert a matrix, and to solve other problems involving matrices.
    
## 8. Euler's Method:
A numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations. The method works by repeatedly applying the derivative of the equation to the current solution to approximate the next solution.
    
## 9. Runge-Kutta Method:
A family of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations. The Runge-Kutta methods are more accurate than the Euler method and are often used to solve differential equations that are difficult to solve analytically.
    
## 10. Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials:
A method for interpolating a set of data points. The method works by constructing a polynomial that passes through the data points. The polynomial can then be used to approximate the value of the function between the data points.
    
## 11. Trapezoidal Rule:
A method for numerical integration. The method works by approximating the area under a curve using a trapezoid. The trapezoidal rule is a simple and accurate method for numerical integration.
    
## 12. Simpson's Rule:
A method for numerical integration. The method works by approximating the area under a curve using a Simpson's rule. Simpson's rule is a more accurate method for numerical integration than the trapezoidal rule.
